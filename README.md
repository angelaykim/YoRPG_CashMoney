#### **Additional Features**
  1. Characters now have the ability to carry out special attacks, which in this case we've named Super Attack and Mega Attack.
  2. We have also added an inventory to the character which will hold potions and coins.
  3. The characters now have the ability to have sidekicks which also have the ability to attack a Monster.
  
#### **Code Restructurings**
  1. To accomodate the special attacks, the driver file was changed so that one the qualifications for a special attack were met, the player would have the ability to call a special attack.
  2. In the Character class, the methods specialAttack1 and specialAttack2 were added as well as the instance variable, specialAttack to keep track of whether or not a special attack can be carried out.
  
  
#### **Instructions**
  1. Choose the level of difficulty you wish to play in.
  2. You will now be promted to choose a Character. Choose wisely!
  3. Please enter what you wish to be called.
  4. When a monster approaches, you have the option to attack or do a special attack. However, once you have done 3 normal or special attacks you will be allowed to do a super attack. If you are extra patient, and do 5 normal attack, you will be able to carry out a mega attack.
  5. Instruct your sidekick to carry out an attack. You have three options for this.
